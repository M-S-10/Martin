# Martin-Works
A documentation of my attempt at making my RC-CAR Autonomous

## Build Stage 1.0

### Hardware 
Make a 1:10 scale model

### Software 
1. Assigning Motor Driver Pin numbers to interface communication from Arduino
2. Defining Functions to Control movement towards intended direction
3. Creating a loop to take continuous input while Bluetooth connection is True
4. Writing Switch statements within the loop to enable the motors to spin (Via Functions) at command
    A. Controlling spin direction of the motors (PWM)
    B. Controlling speed (H-Bridge)

Voila! There you have it.
